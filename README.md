# Codes for Bayesian Optimization
*Written by Joe Aulicino during summer 2020 for use in Dr. Andrew Ferguson's Lab of the Uchicago PME*

The maine functionality is contained in the *main.ipynb* ipython notebook. Currently, a mock functionality score is  calculated from a sequence's Hamming distance to a equal length sequence of alanine. 

The BO object in *main.ipynb* contains the main data and methods for operation and analysis of Bayesian Optimization

The data is fitted using a *GaussianProcessRegressor()* from *sklean*
